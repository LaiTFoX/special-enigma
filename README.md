The first part of the readme has been created before finishing the exercise: this is a readme file for the first project that will showcase our current understanding and level of skill with using HTML language. To do this exercise we are required to compile a simple recipe book website - to do this we will most likely need to create multiple interconnected webpages with hyperlinks, use headings, descriptive text and items lists in the body of these pages, and inject pictures in these webpages.
This part of the readme file has been created after finishing the exercise: as we've mentioned earlier, to complete this exercise we needed to create an interconnected website that uses hyperlinks leading to other webpages, use our understanding of HTML to create ordered and unordered lists, inject pictures in these webpages. Importantly for me it gave me an understanding on what the general outline of a webpage is (for example, the need for a presence of a link to the main page on any of the subject pages).
